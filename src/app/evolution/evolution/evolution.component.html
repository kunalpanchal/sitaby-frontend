    <p>
      The basic framework of humans is designed to move and to stand; sitting is against the primitive design ideology of humans and is the main cause of inactiveness. The researchers have revealed that sitting surely hurts even to the people following a healthy and exercise centric lifestyle. Todayâ€™s lifestyle however, has become sedentary owing to the work hours and need for working while sitting. The scary picture is that sedentary behavior leads to poor health including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular ailments, cancer and finally premature mortality.
      In order to make sitting less harmful, reduce its menace, to create awareness , and to correct and rectify ones posture SitAby, The Posture Proctor is created.

          Appropriate posture sensing algorithm was built to quantify a particular posture. To increase the accuracy of the data sensing we refined posture sensing algorithm for best stance capture. After further analysis of data captured we further refined our logic so that each stance can be explicitly identified.

        <h2>Launch</h2>
        <p>Thus a posture proctor is invented as SitAby, built upon the innovative Internet of Things (IoT) platform supported by unique posture capture, sensing and compiling algorithm in real time. The audio, video and vibrational alerts on error, sedentary behavior and pattern of stances are piously sent to the user and it is ensured that the user corrects the errors and also breaks the longevity of sitting. The unique design makes it truly portable and drafts in a framework for creation of SitAby ready workplaces, libraries, cafes, vehicles and all such spaces where sitting is the prime and unavoidable posture to be.</p>
